                                            <p>	Despite centuries of women’s rights movements and support it remains a current issue which many individuals suffer the consequences of. There remain women and men who feel isolated by the current attitudes towards feminists and are constantly ignored or put down. All people that feel the repercussions of gender inequality can find friends in this isolating experience by reading literature such as Mary Wollestonecraft’s A Vindication of the Rights of Women. Activists can be supported by the knowledge that they are continuing the fight that Wollestonecraft fought for centuries before. Reading how she had to fight for her rights despite the increasingly more difficult environment in that period can inspire people today with a unity to this previous activist. This unity can encourage this movement despite the constant dismissal and disregard. Feeling united to someone in a completely different era establishes how immense the movement is and can fight the isolation that many current activists experience.</p>

												    <p>For most white people, their first instinct is to believe that the police are here to protect them and their property, but for many Black people, their first instinct is that the police are there to protect someone else from them – they are there to make sure that you do not break the law not to protect you from lawbreakers.” -
Lucero, Marissa. “Meaning behind the Movement: Black Lives Matter.” UNM Newsroom, http://news.unm.edu/news/meaning-behind-the-movement-black-lives-matter. Accessed 17 Nov. 2020.</p>
                                                    <p>“Until the philosophy which hold one race superior and another inferior is finally and permanently discredited and abandoned —everywhere is war.”

                                            <p>The recent resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement is the continuation of a battle that has been occurring for centuries. Olaudah Equiano was among the first black men to begin this battle against a philosophy that placed black men and women beneath white people to justify their mistreatment. The current men and women fighting the systemic attitudes of superiority that continue to result in killings and mistreatment are not alone. This current fight can find allies in the literature of Olaudah Equiano who was fighting the same attitudes and injustice. He faced extreme dehumanization in the eyes of fellow men and the justice system and wrote of his experiences to bring the horrors to the eyes of people who otherwise were ignorant. Black Lives Matter is also battling against the masses’ desire to ignore the inhumanity of the current societal mindset and justice system. By looking back to a man who fought his entire life to be viewed as equal we can see that no one is alone in their struggles and there is hope for progress.</p>
